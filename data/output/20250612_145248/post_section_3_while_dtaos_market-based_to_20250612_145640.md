## Key Argument

**[Section 3] While dTAO’s market-based tokenomics incentivize subnet builders to deliver immediate market value, this mechanism also risks encouraging short-termism by disadvantaging subnets focused on long-term, fundamental AI research that may not yield quick token appreciation, potentially stifling innovation that requires sustained investment.**

Market-based tokenomics in Bittensor’s dTAO are a double-edged sword.

On one hand, dTAO’s design brilliantly aligns incentives by letting the market decide which AI subnets deserve resources. Token holders stake TAO into subnet-specific liquidity pools, minting alpha tokens that reflect each subnet’s market value. The higher the alpha token price, the more TAO emissions flow there. This replaces the old, centralized validator-driven model with a decentralized, meritocratic mechanism that rewards real-world value and performance.

Sounds ideal, right?

However, this same market-driven allocation risks sidelining subnets focused on long-term, fundamental AI research. Why? Because deep, groundbreaking AI innovation rarely pays off immediately. Subnets investing in sustained R&D may not see quick alpha token appreciation, putting them at a disadvantage in attracting stake and emissions. The market’s short attention span and preference for rapid returns create pressure to prioritize projects with immediate, tangible outputs — often at the expense of foundational breakthroughs.

This dynamic can unintentionally foster short-termism, where subnet builders optimize for near-term token price gains rather than pioneering the next generation of AI technologies. The consequence? Potentially stifled innovation in areas requiring patience and prolonged investment. Subnets dedicated to experimental architectures, novel learning paradigms, or safety research might struggle to secure the resources they need to thrive.

Moreover, the liquidity and volatility of these alpha tokens add another layer of risk. Staking in subnets with perceived long-term but uncertain payoffs becomes a gamble, discouraging conservative capital allocation toward visionary projects. Without mechanisms to support and buffer these research-focused subnets, the ecosystem risks becoming skewed toward “quick-win” applications rather than balanced AI advancement.

So, while dTAO’s market-based tokenomics democratize and decentralize resource allocation — a major win for the ecosystem’s evolution — they also introduce a subtle but critical tension between market incentives and the nature of AI innovation.

Will the community develop governance or economic tools to protect and nurture long-term fundamental research subnets? Can dTAO evolve to balance the needs of immediate market value and sustained scientific progress?

This challenge is not unique to Bittensor; it echoes traditional venture capital dynamics but here plays out in a fully decentralized, token-driven environment. How Bittensor navigates this will shape whether it becomes just an AI market or a true incubator for transformative AI breakthroughs.

Time will tell. But addressing this tension head-on is essential if Bittensor aims to realize its vision of a decentralized AI ecosystem that truly pushes the frontier.
