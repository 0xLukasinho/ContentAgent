Jesse from Base seems to follow CZ's strategy:

The problem they deal is that simply "asking" or shilling to people to use Base, Zora, or other apps doesn't work anymore. 

Crypto native degens need incentives to take action.

So, CZ, Binance, and BNB Chain (which was losing mindshare and txs) began launching and promoting memecoins like Broccoli.

More importantly, Binance is doing token sales on Pancakeswap via the Binance Web3 Wallet. 

And adding trading on PCS via Binance interface.

(P.s. I believe this closer Binance-Pancakeswap is the reason to the controversial changes in Pancakeswap's tokenomics.)

It worked as BNB Chain txs and Pancakswap volumes picked up! PCS is now 2nd by volumes.


CZ says crypto needs long-term builders, not quick gains. But how to attract new people to BNB Chain if not by speculation?

Base, too, has been trying to promote Zora and other Base dapps (like Farcaster).

It's not easy, so Zora pivoted from NFTs to Contentcoins.

It's an attempt to get rid of negative stigma of memecoins but they aren't much different.

In any case, Zora has seen a record daily revenue.


It works! Love it or hate it but people are using Zora and Base.

The problem with this strategy is that people can lose money: CZ shilled tokens are down only since listing on Binance.

Base should be careful here not to disenchant people if they lose money, too.

Maybe Coinbase will even list "Base is for everyone" content coin.

It could be a success story and would prove early critics who shared it dumping wrong.

Overall, competition is fierce in crypto and teams are taking more risk to attract and maintain users.

Make early users money and they will be loyal to you.
