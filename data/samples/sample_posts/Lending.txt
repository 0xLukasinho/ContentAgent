DeFi lending is a proven product where billions of dollars flow through it every year.

Yet liquidity's scattered everywhere.

Imagine Uber. But instead of showing available cars nearby, it forces you to individually call each driver to check availability. 

Sounds ridiculous? Well, that’s exactly how multichain DeFi lending feels right now.

@0xSoulProtocol changes this. It acts like a unified dashboard for all lending markets:

• Supply assets anywhere.
• Borrow from any chain.
• No more bridging headaches or isolated pools.

But making borrowing easy is just step one.

Here’s the bigger game-changer: Revenue flows directly to you.

Every time someone borrows or lends using Soul - small fees are captured.

These fees don’t vanish into founders’ pockets. They're used to buy back $SO tokens on the open market.

And those tokens go straight to liquidity providers and 
stakers. Meaning the value Soul generates flows directly back to the community that built it.

Soul just launched their public sale - fully open, community-priced and fair. 

If you’re bullish on a unified DeFi layer owned by its users, Do check it out.

Time to fix multichain DeFi lending once and for all.
