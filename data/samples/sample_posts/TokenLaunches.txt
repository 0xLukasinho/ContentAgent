Launching a token is heaven for scammers.

The average startup failure rate is 90%.
In a normal startup, if you’re an investor or founder and your startup fails, you lose everything.

But in crypto things are different.
The long term failure rate of the token is probably 90% or more as well.

But to simply launch a token is not that hard. Most projects that raise venture funding manage to do so. 
And to pump the token for some time is also not that hard. Have some capital, market making, marketing team, buy some listings and it’s done.

And if you can do both these things, then you can probably make money, even if the project ends up failing.
There is no oversight. Founders can easily circumvent their supposed vesting and assign themselves some tokens that they can sell liquid before anyone else. No one can tell on-chain whether that wallet is actually controlled by a founder. Metrics like circulating supply are easily gamed.  

Even if you start out with genuine intentions, there can be grey lines here and the temptation to get money off the table is high. 
And if you’re a scammer, you can’t imagine a better setup than launching a token.  

That is the big issue with crypto. We’re attracting many of the worst people running total or partial scams. And the people who came for the mission and values are getting disillusioned, because that is not what attracted them.  

What will it take to change this? I have no idea. But it needs to happen urgently.
